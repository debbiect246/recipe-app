CARIBBEAN RECIPE APP
---------------------
In this project, I designed a recipe app for users to add, update, or search for caribbean recipes.
My late father was from the Caribbean island of Grenada and I was lucky enough to enjoy many family
holidays on the island in my childhood and later on as an adult with my own family.  I loved the
fresh fruit and vegetables which were cheap and plentiful, sometimes free!  I loved the recipes that 
could be created with these wonderful ingredients.

I thought that it would be a good idea to bring produce an app to store details of user' favourite recipes
and it will also be a good place for users to search for other recipes.  Recipes can be categorised
into breakfast, lunch and dinner recipes and users can rate each recipe for flavour, ease of preparation
and 
The app will also provide statistics on the number of times each recipe is used and show user ratings 
for each user.


UX

User stories
1.	 Each user has a unique username chosen by them and can only add, review, delete and update their own recipes.
2.	 User can choose a recipe from the database and see a summary view of it. 
3.	User can choose from 4 main categories of recipes:  breakfast, lunch, dinner and deserts.
4.	User can also choose from vegetarian, meat based, pescatarian in secondary recipe section and get summary list of each.
5.	 User can add a recipe to the database.
6.	 User can delete any of their recipes from the database.
7.	 User can select a category of recipes to view and select a recipe to view from these.
8.	 Each recipe has a recipe view page which shows a picture, recipe ingredients and method, number of servings, allergens, recipe author, country of origin of the recipe.
9.	 User can get a list of each recipe include in each of breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert recipes.
10.	 User can see statistics on how often each recipe has been used in a given time period.
11.	 User can see statistics on ratings for each recipe.

Wireframes are shown in my UX folder.


Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
1.	 Each user has a unique username chosen by them and can only add, review, delete and update their own recipes.  Sill working on login facility.
2.	 User can choose a recipe from the database and see a summary view of it. Done on allrecipes.html page
3.	User can choose from 3 main categories of recipes:  lunch, dinner and deserts.
4.	User can also choose from vegetarian, meat based, pescatarian in secondary recipe section and get summary list of each.
5.	 User can add a recipe to the database.  Done on addrecipe.html page.
6.	 User can delete any of their recipes from the database.
7.	 Each recipe has a recipe view which shows a picture, recipe ingredients and method, number of servings, allergens, recipe author, country of origin of the recipe.


In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

In the future I can add statistical pages showing ratings for each recipe.

Features Left to Implement

Statistics on ratings for each recipe.
Bar charts showing the number of calories in each recipe.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.


Testing
-------

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
